# Performance Analysis Skill

## Overview

Supports structured analysis of performance considerations at both system and code levels.

## When to use

- Performance optimization tasks
- Load or throughput estimation
- Bottleneck identification
- Latency/cost trade-off evaluation

## Instructions

1. Identify performance objectives and constraints.
2. Describe expected workloads and bottlenecks.
3. Recommend mitigations (caching, parallelism, async mechanisms).
4. Provide methods to measure and validate performance.
5. Suggest monitoring strategies (metrics, logs).

## Examples

**Input:** “Optimize database query patterns for heavy read load.”  
**Output:**  
- Issue analysis  
- Recommendation list  
- Estimated benefit
